<h3>Muir Woods National Monument</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The tallest redwood in Muir Woods National Monument is 258 feet tall. Redwoods can grow as tall as 380 feet.
    </li>
    <li>Muir Woods National Monument is considered to be one of the most popular tourist attractions in the San
        Francisco Bay Area. More than 750,000 people visited the site in 2005 alone.
    </li>
    <li>Congressman William Kent and his wife bought 611 acres of redwoods and mountains to protect the forest. It came
        down to a legal battle in 1907 when a water company wanted to flood the land. Kent donated 295 acres of redwoods
        to the government which stopped the court battle.
    </li>
    <li>Cathedral Grove is the first permanent quiet zone in the national park system. Visitors are asked to walk
        quietly, turn off cellphones and just listen to the forest.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Rocky Mountain National Park</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The high peaks and plains of the Rocky Mountains are still home to numerous indigenous people. You will find
        reserves for the Bannock, Sioux, Blackfoot, Cow People, Apache, Kutenai, and many more.
    </li>
    <li>The highest peak in the Rocky Mountains is Mount Elbert. Mount Elbert is located in the state of Colorado and is
        4401 meters high, or 14,440-feet.

    </li>
    <li>Did you know that all the rivers on the west side of the Rocky Mountains flow to the Pacific Ocean while all
        the rivers on the east side of the Rocky Mountains flow into the Atlantic Ocean? This is because the Rocky
        Mountains literally divide North America, earning them the name of the Continental Divide.
    </li>
    <li>The Rocky Mountains formed 80 million to 55 million years ago during the Laramide orogeny, in which a number of
        plates began sliding underneath the North American plate. The angle of subduction was shallow, resulting in a
        broad belt of mountains running down western North America.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Carlsbad Caverns National Park</h3>

    <li>The caves in Carlsbad Caverns are 56Â°F throughout the year, with high humidity.</li>
